HTML Converter Kata
===================

There are several variants of this exercise in this repo. They all present slightly different challenges. You can expect to learn more about test design, SOLID principles and testability by working on them. 

UnicodeFileToHtmlTextConverter
------------------------------
Write the unit tests for the UnicodeFileToHtmlTextConverter class. This class is designed to reformat a plain text file for display in a browser. 

Bonus: identify which of the SOLID principles this code violates.

HtmlPagesConverter
------------------
Write the unit tests for the HtmlPagesConverter class. This class is designed to reformat a plain text file for display in a browser, one page at a time.

HtmlConverter
-------------
Write unit tests that expose the bugs. Bugs are marked with a comment in the code. You should preserve the original interface to the class.

The original exercise was designed by Luca Minudel and is included in his repo [TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples](https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples), which form the basis of the repo [Racing Car Katas](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas). The other exercise variants found here were invented by Emily Bache.
